Per-user operation tracking
1-hour time window
Automatic operation cleanup


Transfer Safety

Security Analysis
Protected Against

✅ Flash loan attacks via sliding window
✅ Transfer fee tokens through amount verification
✅ Reentrancy attacks
✅ Basic overflow/underflow
✅ Insufficient balance issues
✅ Rate manipulation

Partial Protection

⚠️ Front-running (standard approvals only)
⚠️ Gas limits (no array size limit)

Needs Additional Protection

❌ Emergency situations
❌ Stuck tokens
❌ Permit functionality

Identified Risks
Medium Severity

Emergency Controls

No pause mechanism
No token recovery function
Impact: Could be problematic in emergency situations


Front-Running Risk

Standard ERC20 approvals can be front-run
No EIP-2612 permit support
Impact: Potential for transaction ordering exploitation


Gas Limit Risk

Operation cleanup could hit block gas limit
Large operation arrays could make functions unusable
Impact: Potential DoS under specific conditions



Low Severity

Rate Limit Configuration

No upper bounds on rate limits
Could be set to very high values
Impact: Potential for misconfiguration


Event Information

Events could include more details
Limited historical tracking
Impact: Reduced transparency
